    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>He is usually nonchalant and playful towards people such as his students and colleagues, but unsympathetic and cruel with people such as the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Jujutsu_Sorcerer">Shaman Executives</a>.</li>
      <li>He is very confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer; casually dismissing personal threats from Sukuna and saying that he could defeat the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sukuna">King of Curses</a> easily.</li>
    </ol>
